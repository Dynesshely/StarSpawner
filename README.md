# Console Version

Want to pretend to be awesome? Here you go!

## Effects

> The dense block generation in Figure 3 (lower left corner) below is the effect when the number of daily submissions is fixed in the specified interval (2015-6-14 to 2015-9-27) and the density is 0.7

## What can it do

1. Can quickly increase the number of Commits of the project
2. Contributions that can quickly fill up GitHub / Gitlab / Gitee
3. Can be used to pretend to be very powerful

## Publish

Compile and execute this command locally (based on .NET 5, make sure you have a valid SDK installed)

```shell
dotnet publish -r win-x86 -c release -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

In addition, please specify the `-r` parameter for different platforms <br>
Options (macOS options are unknown, you can explore by yourself):

1. win-x86
2. win-x64
3. linux-x86
4. linux-x64

## Download

1. In GitHub Release, download the latest version of the exe program and store it in the Git Root Directory of our Project that needs Commits (ensure that contains a hidden ".git" folder)
2. Run the downloaded exe program and follow the prompts

## Use

### Prerequisites

1. Requires full git tool installation
2. Make sure that you can use the git command
3. Make sure that the origin of the local repository has added the repository address of GitHub or other hosting platforms
4. Make sure that the local key configuration is complete, you can push directly, otherwise please push manually

### How to use?

The menu currently has four items

1. Simply contribute every selected day

   Description: Commits r times a day from n days ago to today (r can choose fixed (unlimited times) or random (up to 40 times a day (you can modify the source code to lift the limit)), Commits is a random string

2. Simply contribute with random lively commit message

   Description: The function is similar to `Option 1`, but Commits is a real message, format: `type(scope): subject` The details are as follows:
   
   * type: type (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
   
   * scope: scope of change, optional, mostly file name or directory
   
   * subject: Brief overview of the changes and their effects
   
   (This template is generated by referring to [Mr. Ruan Yifeng's blog](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2016/01/commit_message_change_log.html))
   
3. Lively contribute with lively commit message

   Description: Similar to `Option 1`, but allows manual setting of start and end dates, and Commits is a simulacrum message
   
4. Lively contribute with lively commit message with density

   Description: The function is similar to `Option 1`, but the density submission function is added (🎷Blowout (normally distributed random number implementation)): You need to manually set the density and the maximum number of submissions per day, and allow you to manually set the start and end dates. Commits is Realistic news

## How it works

The git commit command allows the use of the `--date` parameter to specify the commit date, and GitHub calculates Contributions by the date of Commits. This program repeats the process of "creating files, specifying commit dates, committing, and deleting" this process, to make your GitHub fake. Contributions look awesome!

# Graphical Version

## Prerequisites

Make sure your config is ready for conconcon-tri-buter.exe (Console Version) first, then Graphical Version

## How to use

1. Copy latest Released two programs in cctb-wpf.zip into root directory where .git directory are
2. Execute cctb-wpf.exe
3. Select dates that to commit, and set commit numbers
4. Start commit

## Publish

Make sure you have total source code, and the `cctb-wpf` folder and `conconcon-tri-buter` folder are in same path<br>
Use cmd or powershell and change directory to `cctb-wpf` folder<br>
Execute:

```shell
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained false
```

Arguments for `-r` are same with Console Version part in this README.md
